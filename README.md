"Road Quality Survey App" (RQSA) project. All project documentation is maintained within the [project Wiki](https://github.com/empug/road-quality-project/wiki)


# Overview
This project is a group activity to design, build, and enhance a python based project. After some discussion, the group selected a "Road Quality" measuring webapp. The hardware consists of a [micro:bit](http://microbit.org) microcontroller containing an embedded accelormeter, compass, bluetooth, tactile buttons, and LED array. The supporting code for the micro:bit is written in [MicroPython](https://micropython.org), a modified version of regular python designed to run on embedded hardware. 

The micro:bit is stocked at a number of retailers. We've found [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3362) and [MicroCenter](http://www.microcenter.com/product/480034/MicroBit_Go_Kit) to be the cheapest so far @ $16.50. 

### Quick Notes:
* This project is based around MicroPython v1.9. This implements python 3.4 compatible syntax.
* To contribute to this project, please open a pull request.
